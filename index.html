                <span class="fs-2">The</span> Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX)[9] is an American spacecraft manufacturer, launcher, and satellite 
            communications corporation headquartered in Hawthorne, California. It was founded in 2002 by Elon Musk 
            with the stated goal of reducing space transportation costs to enable the colonization of Mars.
             The company manufactures the Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy, and Starship launch vehicles;
             several rocket engines; Cargo Dragon and Crew Dragon spacecraft; and Starlink communications satellites.
            </p>
            <p>
                The company is also developing Starship, a privately funded, fully reusable,
                 super heavy-lift launch system for interplanetary and orbital spaceflight.
                 It is intended to become SpaceX's primary orbital vehicle, supplanting the existing Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy, and Dragon fleet.
            </p>
            <p>
                SpaceX is the first private company to develop a liquid-propellant rocket that has reached orbit; to launch, orbit, and recover a spacecraft; to send a spacecraft to the International Space Station; and to send astronauts to orbit and to the International Space Station. It is also the first organization of any type to achieve vertical propulsive landing of an orbital
                 rocket booster and the first to reuse such a booster. SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets have
                  landed and reflown more than 150 times.
